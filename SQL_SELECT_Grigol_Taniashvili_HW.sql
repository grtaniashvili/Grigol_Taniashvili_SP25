------------------------------ Part 1: Write SQL queries to retrieve the following data
--All animation movies released between 2017 and 2019 with rate more than 1, alphabetical
-- 1. We filter films by release year and rental rate to meet the conditions.
-- 2. We use INNER JOINs to connect films with categories.
-- 3. We ensure that only "Animation" category films are included.
-- 4. Sorting is done alphabetically using ORDER BY title.

--The revenue earned by each rental store after March 2017 (columns: address and address2 â€“ as one column, revenue)
-- 1. We concatenate address fields to display them as one.
-- 2. We sum up payments made after March 2017 to calculate revenue.
-- 3. We group by store address to get total revenue per store.
-- 4. Sorting is done in descending order to show highest revenue stores first.

-- 1. We filter movies released after 2015.
-- 2. We use COUNT() to determine the number of movies each actor has been in.
-- 3. We group by actor to ensure we count per individual.
